# Project2---Newsference

## 1. Top-Level Idea (No-Code)

*Concept:* Create a web page or application that aggregates news articles based on user-defined keywords, then quantifies each article’s political leaning (left, center, right) and provides other indices like “Event Likelihood,” “Relevance,” and “Relatedness.”

*Goal:* Help users quickly assess differing viewpoints and gauge how important or credible a story might be across multiple political and analytical dimensions.

## 2. System Design

### User Interface:


A search bar where users enter keywords.

A results page listing articles relevant to those keywords.
An article detail view showing “Left/Right Leaning Index,” “Event Likelihood,” and optional advanced metrics.
Data Sources:

News APIs or RSS feeds (e.g., Google News, Ground News, or other aggregators).

A classification model (ML or heuristic-based) for political leaning.

Additional scoring logic for relevance and likelihood of events.

## 3. Architecture:

*Front End:* Browser-based UI or downloadable app built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or a framework like React).
*Back End:* Python/Node.js server that fetches articles, runs classification and scoring, then returns summarized data to the client.
*Database:* Stores article metadata, user interactions, or advanced analytics for faster retrieval.

## 3. Step-by-Step Implementation (With Potential Code)

### Article Ingestion:

Write a small script (Python, Node.js, etc.) to query external APIs (e.g., NewsAPI, RSS feeds).
Parse incoming JSON/XML results and store them temporarily in memory or a database.
Classification and Scoring

Political Leaning: Use a basic NLP model (e.g., a Python scikit-learn classifier) trained on known left/right sample texts, or heuristics based on recognized sources.
Event Likelihood: Simple keyword analysis (e.g., “confirmed,” “official,” “rumor,” “alleged”) or advanced models that assign probabilities.
Relevance/Importance: Tally occurrences of user keywords, plus article recency, source credibility, and clickthrough rate.
Relatedness (optional): For advanced features, compute article-to-article similarity with vector embeddings (e.g., using spaCy or Sentence Transformers).
Summary Generation: Summarize each article and group them by category (left, center, right). A library like spaCy or gensim can be used, or even OpenAI GPT-based summarization if feasible.

Front-End Display

Build a basic HTML page (or React app) that lists articles with their indices.
When an article is clicked, show more detailed data (e.g., Leaning, Event Likelihood, Relevance Score).
Optional: E-Commerce / SSH Shop

Integrate a basic store or donation system if you want to monetize or collect support for the project.
Could be implemented via a simple PayPal or Stripe integration.

## 4. Impact and Future Ideas

Impact:

Empowers users to see multiple viewpoints, reducing echo chambers.
Offers quick, data-driven insights into political biases, event probability, and article importance.
Encourages more nuanced understanding and discussion around current events.

Future Directions:

Incorporate user feedback loops, letting users vote on perceived bias or correctness.
Automate advanced AI-based summarization for global issues, grouping them into one “master summary.”
Expand to additional metrics (e.g., sentiment analysis, ethical rating, or corporate ownership transparency).
Integrate crowd-sourced fact-checking to further enhance the reliability of displayed articles.
